This should not normally be needed, but on some file systems it may help mitigate issues where the file has just been closed and not exposed correctly at the posix layer.</p><h2 id="maxconnections-unsigned" tabindex="-1">maxConnections (unsigned) <a class="header-anchor" href="#maxconnections-unsigned" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;maxConnections (unsigned)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This is a DFU Server setting. If set, it will limit the maximum number of parallel connections and partition streams that will be active at any one time. By default a DFU job will run as many active connection/streams as there are partitions involved in the spray, limited to an absolute maximum of 800. Setting maxConnections can be set to reduce this concurrency. This might be helpful in some scenarios where the concurrency is causing network congestion and degraded performance.</p><h2 id="keepalive-time-unsigned-interval-unsigned-probes-unsigned" tabindex="-1">keepalive (time: unsigned, interval: unsigned, probes: unsigned) <a class="header-anchor" href="#keepalive-time-unsigned-interval-unsigned-probes-unsigned" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;keepalive (time: unsigned, interval: unsigned, probes: unsigned)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>See keepalive example above. If set, these settings will override the system default socket keepalive settings each time the platform creates a socket. This may be useful in some scenarios if the connections would otherwise be closed prematurely by external factors (e.g. firewalls). An example of this is that Azure instances will close sockets that have been idle for greater than 4 minutes that are connected outside of its networks.</p><h2 id="savequerydlls-boolean" tabindex="-1">saveQueryDlls (boolean) <a class="header-anchor" href="#savequerydlls-boolean" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;saveQueryDlls (boolean)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This is a Thor only setting. Default: false If false, query dlls are loaded directly from the default &#39;dll&#39; plane by both the Thor manager and Thor workers. If true, query dlls will be saved and cached in local temporary storage and serialized to the workers. Saving and serializing the query dlls may speed up queries if the &#39;dll&#39; plane is backed by slow storage (e.g. blob storage).</p><h2 id="exceptionhandler-list-of-class-string-code-unsigned-cmd-string" tabindex="-1">exceptionHandler (list of { class: string, code: unsigned, cmd: string }) <a class="header-anchor" href="#exceptionhandler-list-of-class-string-code-unsigned-cmd-string" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;exceptionHandler (list of { class: string, code: unsigned, cmd: string })&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Exception handlers can be added at a global or per component level. Each exception handler must define the &#39;class&#39; (one of &quot;string&quot;, &quot;errno&quot;, &quot;os&quot;, &quot;socket&quot;) and &#39;code&#39; number of the exception to handle, and the command to run (&#39;cmd&#39;).

Setting expert.allowForeign to true, enables foreign access for compatibility with legacy bare-metal environments that have their Dali and Dafilesrv&#39;s open.</p><h2 id="regex-cachesize-unsigned" tabindex="-1">regex (cacheSize: unsigned) <a class="header-anchor" href="#regex-cachesize-unsigned" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;regex (cacheSize: unsigned)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>See the regex example above. If set, this should be added at the global level. The default value is 500. Set to zero to disable the cache. This value is applied at the process level: Each Thor worker, Roxie process, and hthor worker receives its own cache. Threads/channels within a process share that process&#39;s cache.</p><h1 id="plane-expert-settings" tabindex="-1">Plane Expert Settings <a class="header-anchor" href="#plane-expert-settings" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Plane Expert Settings&quot;">​</a></h1><h2 id="validateplanescript-list-of-string" tabindex="-1">validatePlaneScript (list of { string }) <a class="header-anchor" href="#validateplanescript-list-of-string" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;validatePlaneScript (list of { string })&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Optional list of bash commands to execute within an init container in pods that use this plane. This can be used to validate that the plane is healthy, e.g. that it is mounted as expected.

This setting will introduce a delay if a read operation is within this margin period.

NB: ENOENT and ENOTDIR as file not present. 1 = ignore EACCES - suppre exception, returns false. 2 = ignore all other errors - suppress exception, return false. This was the legacy behaviour.
